This repository contains the components needed to build a CLIP 3D printing dynamic software including GUI. Note that you needed Visual Studio and the Qt extension in visual studio to be able to build the full program. The software is designed to run with the SMC100CC Newport Stage controller and the SM12 SiCube UV Projector.  

The software is yet to be extensively tested.
